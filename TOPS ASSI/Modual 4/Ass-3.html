    <hr>
    <p>
        =>CSS3 represents the latest iteration of CSS, offering enhanced and more advanced features compared to CSS2. <br>
        =>Let's explore the differences between CSS2 and CSS3 based on various criteria. <br>
        [1]Selector Type:- <br>
            =>CSS2 employs selectors like element names, IDs, and classes. <br>
            =>CSS3 introduces Pseudo-classes, Pseudo-elements, and descendant selectors for more refined selections. <br>
        [2]Text:- <br>
            =>CSS2 utilizes properties such as font style, font weight, font size, text align, etc., for text formatting. <br>
            =>CSS3 expands text styling with features like text shadow, text-overflow, and gradient colors for fonts. <br>
        [3]Background Gradient:- <br>
            =>CSS2 is limited to solid color backgrounds. <br>
            =>CSS3 introduces advanced options like linear-gradient and radial-gradient for creating gradient backgrounds. <br>
        [4]Element Position:- <br>
            =>CSS2 relies on margin and float for positioning elements on a webpage. <br>
            =>CSS3 introduces modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid for more sophisticated page layouts. <br>
        [5]Animation:- <br>
            =>CSS2 lacks facilities for creating animations. <br>
            =>CSS3 empowers developers to craft diverse and aesthetically pleasing animations. <br>
        [6]Media Queries:- <br>
            =>CSS2 struggles to create responsive webpages. <br>
            =>CSS3 enables the creation of responsive designs through the use of media queries. <br>
