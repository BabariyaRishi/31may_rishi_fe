    <h1>Q-16 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <b>Ans:-</b> <br>
        <b>Advantages:-</b> <br>
        =>>External CSS files can be shared by multiple HTML pages.<br><br>
        =>>You do not need to change your existing HTML code if you decide to make changes in the design layout (for example: colors or fonts). <br><br>
        =>>CSS code is easier to maintain.<br><br>
        =>>It helps us to avoid repetition of same properties throughout different webpages.<br><br>
        =>>We can change styles for all elements on one page at once without changing any other part of the webpage.<br><br>
        <b>Disadvantages:-</b> <br>
        =>>Each external style sheet requires an additional HTTP request to fetch the CSS file from the server. This can impact page load times, especially if there are multiple external style sheets. <br><br>
        =>>We have to link an external stylesheet for every page we want to use its styles on.<br><br>
        =>>The browser has to download all the linked stylesheets before rendering any webpage.<br><br>
