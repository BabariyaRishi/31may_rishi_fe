        <b>Ans:-</b> <br><br>
        ->Background property is a shorthand for setting the following three CSS3 properties: <br><br>
        ->background-color, background-image, and background-repeat.<br><br>
        ->The background image can contain any valid HTML element or pseudo-element (such as ::before). It will not work if you use an inline style on <br><br>
        ->The reason why we use this method of writing CSS code is that it makes our code more compact by eliminating repetition in the same style rules. <br><br>
        ->Color property sets the foreground colour of an element's text usually text within &lt;a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, or <br><br>
        ->The background property can also set all these values at once by using one of the following methods:<br><br>
        ->Color property sets the foreground colour of an element's text (usually referred to as its "text color"). <br><br>
        ->Background-position can also be set using this property but it has to come after all other values have been declared except of course if you want to
