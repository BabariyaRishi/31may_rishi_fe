    <h1>Q-17 What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <b>Ans:-</b> <br>
        =>>A CSS selector is a pattern that tells the browser which HTML elements to style. It is the first part of a
        CSS rule, followed by a curly brace ({}) and a list of CSS properties and values. <br><br>
        =>>There are many different types of CSS selectors, but some of the most common include: <br><br>
        <b>1.Element selectors:-</b> <br>
        =>Select HTML elements by their name, such as p, h1, div, and img. <br><br>
        <b>2.Class selectors:-</b> <br>
        =>Select HTML elements with a specific class attribute, such as .my-class and .my-other-class. <br><br>
        <b>3.ID selectors:-</b> <br>
        =>Select HTML elements with a specific ID attribute, such as #my-id and #my-other-id. <br><br>
        <b>4.Class selectors:-</b> <br>
        =>Select HTML elements with a specific class attribute value, such as .my-class or .my-other-class.<br><br>
        <b>5.Pseudo-Class Selector:-</b> <br>
        =>This selector allows you to target elements based on their state or position, such as :hover for mouse hover,
        :first-child for the first child element, or :nth-child(n) to select elements based on their position within a
        parent element. <br><br>
        <b>6.Universal Selector:-</b> <br>
        =>This selector selects all elements on the page and is denoted by an asterisk (*). For example, * { color: red;
        } would apply the color red to all elements.
