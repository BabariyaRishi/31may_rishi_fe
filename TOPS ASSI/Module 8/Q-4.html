    <h1>Q-4 What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Bootstrap grid system is a powerful tool that allows developers to create responsive and mobile-first
        website. <br> <br>

        The Bootstrap Grid System is a responsive, mobile-first grid system developed by Twitter as part of the
        Bootstrap framework. It is a powerful and flexible layout system that allows developers to create responsive and
        consistent designs across various screen sizes. <br> <br>

        <b>features of the Bootstrap Grid System:</b> <br> <br>

        <b>Responsive Design:</b> The grid system is designed to be responsive, meaning that it adjusts and adapts to
        different
        screen sizes, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. <br> <br>

        <b>Container:</b> The grid system is wrapped in a container, which helps to manage the layout and ensure proper
        alignment. There are two types of containers: .container (fixed-width container) and .container-fluid
        (full-width container). <br> <br>

        <b>Rows:</b> Inside the container, the layout is organized into rows. Rows are horizontal groups of columns that
        help
        structure the content. <br> <br>

        <b>Columns:</b> Columns are the building blocks of the grid system. They are placed inside rows and are used to
        define
        the layout of the content. Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system by default, and you can specify the width of
        each column based on a 12-column layout. <br> <br>

        <b>Column Classes:</b> Bootstrap provides a set of responsive utility classes to define the width of columns.
        These
        classes are named based on the device size (e.g., col-sm, col-md, col-lg) and the number of columns (e.g., col-6
        for half-width). <br> <br>

        <b>For Example:-</b> <br>
        &lt;div class="container"&gt; <br>
        &lt; class="row"&gt; <br>
        &lt; class="col-sm-6"&gt; <br>
        <!-- Content for the first column --> <br>
        &lt;/div&gt; <br>
        &lt; class="col-sm-6" &gt; <br>
        <!-- Content for the second column --> <br>
        &lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &lt;/div&gt;<br>
        &lt;/div&gt;
