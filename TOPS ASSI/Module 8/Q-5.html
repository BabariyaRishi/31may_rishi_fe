    <h1>Q-5 What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
       Bootstrap 4 And Bootstrap 5 Major  Differences are as follows: <br>
       =>>Bootstrap 4 relies on jQuery for some of its functionality, while Bootstrap 5 has removed this dependency. Bootstrap 5 encourages the use of vanilla JavaScript. <br>
       =>>Bootstrap 5 introduces a new Utilities API that provides a set of Sass-based utilities, allowing developers to create custom styles more easily. <br>
       =>>Bootstrap 5 introduces some new components, such as the offcanvas component for creating off-canvas side navigation. <br>
       =>>Bootstrap 5 has improved documentation and provides better theming options compared to Bootstrap 4. It includes a new theme API, making it easier to customize the look and feel of the framework. etc..
